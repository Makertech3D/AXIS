# Linear Rail Upgrade

**This upgrade is a work in progress, files have not yet been finalised. More info to follow.**

We're working on creating an upgrade that would add a total of four linear rails to the Axis printer. One for the Z and Y axis and two for the X-axis (platform). Below is what we think it will look like.
The parts in red would be 3d printed. The hardest part of the upgrade would be drilling the holes into the metal parts for the rails. 

We will be releasing a video guide for this upgrade.

As you can see we're using three different size rails:

    x2 MGN7-H with two carriages each for the platform (x-axis)
    x1 MGN9-H for the Hotend (y-axis)
    x1 MGN15-H for the Gantry (z-axis)
